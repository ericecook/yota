Yota
================

Yota is a Python form library that aims to make generation of web forms fast yet flexible. It is designed to work with AJAX submission/validation or conventional submission methods. If you’re trying to do something simple Yota’s default should be well equipped for your needs, however it is still configurable enough to let you do more complex actions, even ones it wasn’t originally designed to handle. Yota attempts to allow several ways to do things when it makes sense, but tries at all costs to avoid syntax that is overly confusing or non-obvious.
