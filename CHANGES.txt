0.2.0 (2013-06-28)
------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added some more built-in Nodes and Validators such as
  StrongPasswordValidator, MatchingValidator, RegexValidator, CheckboxNode,
  etc.

- Refactored all validation functions to return both a success bool value
  alongside its output, making post-validation logic more clear and concise.

Refactor for Client Side Funcionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Completely re-wrote the JavaScript library into a jQuery plugin.

- Moved the selection loigc for Nodes that are "ready" to be validated into
  server side, incurring marginal overheads.

- Changed the error_render call semantics to track which Nodes have errors and
  intelligently call the function.

- Improved error rendering to support multiple errors.

- Re-designed the semantic which finds the HTML node in which to place errors
  on a per Node basis. json_identifiers function now passes these details to
  the client side code allowing more flexible rendering.

- Allowed per-Node logic for deciding if the Node is ready to be validated
  based on a list of visited Nodes.

- Added a more robust render_success method that allows passing arbitrary
  information to drive things like redirects, etc.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Large expansions in the documentation in almost all areas. More should be
  coming steadily in the next few weeks.

- Re-wrote the yota_examples repository for improved clarity and commenting.

Maintenance/Stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Introduced simple functional tests to attempt coverage for behaviour that
  cannot be unit tested

- Added commenting and specificity to existing unit tests

- Added more unit tests to regain near 100% coverage. Touch ups to come soon.

0.1.6 (2013-06-26)
------------------

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed textarea node not passing data properly

- Bug related to passing lists of validators into the shorthand for nodes

- Minor issue removing the deep copy with new breaking multi-form pages with
  dynamic options

0.1.5 (2013-06-09)
------------------

Maintenance/Stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Put the project under the new-BSD license.

- Some commenting cleanup

- Increased test coverage to 100% and improved quality of assertions.  Caught
  several bugs in the process, leading to numerous minor bug fixes.

- Fixed PEP8 compliance.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- JavaScript bugs related to AJAX.

- Fixed several bugs related to operation in Python 2.6. All tests now pass
  with 2.6.

- Fixed a significant bug in which many class attributes should have been
  instance attributes, and thus cropping up strange errors.

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Beginnings of some functional tests

- Added optional redirect on AJAX success

- Added new grouped elements node designed for radio buttons.

- Allowed easily overriding the action of a form with a keyword attribute
  passed to the start node or the form kwargs.
